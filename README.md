# BytePusher in C
### developed by owitrz
This file contains my attempt at a BytePusher implementation in C. 

A BytePusher is a specification created by Javamannen in 2010 that is effectively a simplified CHIP-8 emulator. It is a virtual machine that utilises the ByteByteJump One Instruction Set Computer architecture, where each instruction is structure A,B,C. Where A (the source address) is moved to B (the destination address) before jumping to C (the jump address)


I am going to be writing in C because I have a little experience in C. I want to tackle problems like this within something like Rust or Zig after, but I thought C will give me a headstart instead of trying to learn how to write a small emulater AND a new language at the same time.
This code is going to be written using the following links, with minimal use of Gen AI to support my work. I will NOT use Gen AI to generate any code I use in the final implementation of the project, I will only use it to explain concepts. This is just an effort to learn a bit more than I would if AI wrote the whole thing :P

Important Links:

  - Raylib is a popular game programming library written for C and C++. I have chosen this because I wanted to learn it, it is meant to be relatively simple and easy to get going, and it able to support mono channel audio streams and easy drawing to the screen.

Build instructions are as follows:
